/**
 *  A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as
 *  a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node
 *  is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list
 *  of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that:
 *    1) no reference is duplicated, and 
 *    2) none points to the root.
